# Page Replacement
This is a C++ program that implements different page replacement algorithms by simulating a demand-paging scenario

To execute: you will need to compile and run the pagereplacement.cpp file using a C++ compiler

Instructions: 
The program will ask the user to input a page reference string and the number of frames. Once given the information, the program will simulate the following page replacement algorithms:

1. LRU (Least Recently Used)
2. Optimal
3. FIFO (First In First Out)

The program will output a line for each step in the process, detailing whether a page fault occurred, listing the contents of the current frame table, and the number of faults so far.
Once an algorithm has finished, the program will print the total number of page faults that occurred for that algorithm.
